          Puffy and full of pizzazz...flaky and crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. The main ingredients are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and butter. The mighty croissant is a crescent-shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough. The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded. The final dough is cut into triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.
